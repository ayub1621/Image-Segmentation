## Introduction
Nuclei image segmentation is an essential task in biomedical image analysis, where the goal is to accurately identify and delineate nuclei within microscopic images. The U-net architecture is a popular deep learning model for image segmentation tasks, known for its effectiveness in capturing fine details and producing accurate segmentations.

This program leverages the U-net architecture to perform nuclei image segmentation. It is implemented in Python, utilizing popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras. The Jupyter Lab environment provides an interactive interface for running and modifying the program.

## Installation
To run this program, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Lab
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Scikit-Image

You can install these dependencies using `pip` by running the following command:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib scikit-image
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayub1621/Nuclei-Image-Segmentation.git
cd Nuclei-Image-Segmentation
```

## Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Lab by running the following command in the project directory:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

2. In Jupyter Lab, open the `Nuclei Segmentation using U-Net.ipynb` notebook.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load and preprocess the nuclei image dataset, build and train the U-net model, and perform nuclei segmentation on test images.

4. Customize the parameters and network architecture based on your requirements. You can experiment with different hyperparameters, network depth, and augmentation techniques to improve the segmentation results.

5. Run the code cells in the notebook to execute the program and visualize the segmentation results.

## Results
The program aims to produce accurate nuclei segmentations based on input microscopic images. The quality of the segmentations depends on factors such as the size and diversity of the training dataset, the architecture of the U-net model, and the effectiveness of the training process.

You can evaluate the performance of the model using evaluation metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) or Dice coefficient. Additionally, you may consider using post-processing techniques such as morphological operations or connected component analysis to refine the segmentation results further.
